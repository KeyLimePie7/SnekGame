# Hello
This is a simple snake game I made using purely html, css and javascript. 
It's another simple project for me to practice programming.
It has its bugs and faults, and there definitely is room for improvement.

# How to use
Just open index.html in a web browser.
The controls are I, J, K and L.
Have fun :)

Here's how it looks like in action:
